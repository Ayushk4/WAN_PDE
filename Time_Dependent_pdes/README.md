Nonlinear diffusion-reaction of the form

  ut − ∆u − u<sup>2</sup> = f(x, t), in Ω × [0, T]

  u(x, t) = g(x, t), on ∂Ω × [0, T]

  u(x, 0) = h(x), in Ω

Where Ω = (−1, 1)d ⊂ R<sup>d</sup> where d=5 in this case. T (time) spans [0,1]


**Note:**
  In the plots, Horizontal axis is time axis and vertical is along x<sub>1</sub>
